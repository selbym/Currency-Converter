This Python script is a currency converter that allows users to convert amounts between USD, Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound. It defines functions for converting a specified amount from one of these currencies to the others, displaying the results. The main function guides the user through selecting a currency and entering an amount to convert, then calls the appropriate conversion function based on the user's choice. The script includes input validation to ensure valid currency choices and numeric amounts are entered.
